I always advocate for explicit return types, especially when working with other developers. Of course, not everything can be typed; in some cases, you need to let the type be inferred. However, most of the time, this isn't the case.

The problem is that you can't just specify the success return type without having to explicitly specify the errors and requirements:

```ts
const divide = (a: number, b: number): Effect.Effect<number> =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    if (b === 0) {
      return yield* Effect.fail(new Error("Divide by zero"));
    }

    return a / b;
  });
```

You will get a TypeScript error:

```
Type '(a: number, b: number) => Effect.Effect<number, Error, never>' is not assignable to type 'Effect<number, never, never>'
```

That's because, if you don't pass in the other types, they will default to `never`, and `never` is not assignable to `Error`.

You can define them explicitly if you want:

```ts
declare const divide: (a: number, b: number) => Effect.Effect<number, Error>
```

However, I do not recommend doing this. Why? Because TypeScript simply ensures that whatever you're returning satisfies the type:

```ts
const divide= (a: number, b: number): Effect.Effect<number, Error | string> =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    if (b === 0) {
      return yield* Effect.fail(new Error("Divide by zero"));
    }

    return a / b;
  });
```

Notice how our error channel is `Error | string`. We are never failing with `string`. It's easy to make this mistake; what if you have over six errors? And later on, you can narrow them down to just three. You need to make sure to update the type accordingly. If you don't, you're potentially lying to the consumer.

I'm not saying you should never type out your errors; there are cases where you want to ensure that you're failing with a certain subset of errors. But generally speaking, you just want to type out the success channel.

For this, I'd recommend creating an identity function that only restricts `A` to be the one you pass in:

```ts
const withSuccessReturnType =
  <A>() =>
  <E, R>(effect: Effect.Effect<A, E, R>): Effect.Effect<A, E, R> =>
    effect;
```

Now, you can do the following:

```ts
const divide = (a: number, b: number) =>
  pipe(
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      if (b === 0) {
        return yield* Effect.fail(new Error("Divide by zero"));
      }

      return a / b;
    }),
    withSuccessReturnType<number>()
  );
```
