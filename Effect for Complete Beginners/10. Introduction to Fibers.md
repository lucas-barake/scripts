Promises in JavaScript can be non-blocking, meaning that they allow subsequent code to execute even if the promise is pending. This is because promises are deferred to the event loop. To achieve this behavior in Effect, you need to understand fibers.

In Effect, all executed tasks are managed by fibers. Fibers are computations or operations that control these tasks. They have a unique property: they can be started, interrupted, paused, and resumed.

Let's take this simple example:

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect";

const program = Effect.log("1!");

const program2 = Effect.log("2!");

Effect.runSync(program);
Effect.runSync(program2);
```

This will log to the console:

```
timestamp=2024-07-02T22:02:30.549Z level=INFO fiber=#0 message="1!"
timestamp=2024-07-02T22:02:30.555Z level=INFO fiber=#1 message=2!
```

Note the `fiber=#0` and `fiber=#1` in the output. Effect tracks the fibers that have been executed, assigning each a unique identifier.

## Using `fork`

To run an asynchronous task without blocking, we can use the `fork` operation:

```ts
const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
  yield* Effect.sleep("3 seconds").pipe(
    Effect.andThen(Effect.log("Waited 3 seconds")),
    Effect.fork
  );

  console.log("executed...");

  yield* Effect.sleep("5 seconds");
});

Effect.runPromise(program);
```

Here, we immediately schedule the log of `Effect.log("Waited 3 seconds")` to be executed in 3 seconds. Since we forked this task, its lifetime is bound to the parent's lifetime, meaning it cannot outlive the execution of its parent.

For demonstration purposes (and to see an actual output), we added an `Effect.sleep("5 seconds")` at the end, ensuring that the lifetime of the main fiber is approximately 5 seconds. This allows the forked task to be executed:

```ts
executed...
timestamp=2024-07-02T22:06:30.341Z level=INFO fiber=#1 message="Waited 3 seconds"
```

As you can see, it logged to the console `"executed..."` first, and then, after 3 seconds, we get `"Waited 3 seconds"`.

If we change the `console.log` to a `yield* Effect.log` we get:

```
timestamp=2024-07-02T22:11:16.293Z level=INFO fiber=#0 message=executed...
timestamp=2024-07-02T22:11:16.316Z level=INFO fiber=#1 message="Waited 3 seconds"
```

As we can see, the main fiber is `#0` and the forked fiber is `#1`.

### Fiber Lifetime and Parent-Child Relationship

If we recall, I told you that `fork` binds the lifetime of the created fiber to the parent fiber. Meaning that, if the parent fiber were to finish executing before the fork could get executed, the forked fiber will be discarded entirely:

```ts
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.sleep("3 seconds").pipe(
    Effect.andThen(Effect.log("Waited 3 seconds")),
    Effect.fork
  );

  yield* Effect.log("executed...");
});

Effect.runPromise(program);
```

```
timestamp=2024-07-02T22:12:35.330Z level=INFO fiber=#0 message=executed...
```

As you can see, we only get the last log to the console, and `"Waited 3 seconds"` is nowhere to be seen. This is known as automatic supervision. When using `fork`, it automatically supervises your fibers to ensure they do not outlive their parent fiber.

This differs to what you're used to when dealing with promises:

```ts
async function someTask() { ...
}

async function someFunction() {
  void someTask();
  return
...
}

await someFunction();
```

Even if `someFunction` finishes, `someTask` will still be executed, hence its lifetime is not bound to `someFunction`.

If you want to achieve behavior similar to unbound Promises, you can use `forkDaemon` instead:

```ts
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.sleep("3 seconds").pipe(
    Effect.andThen(Effect.log("Waited 3 seconds")),
    Effect.forkDaemon
  );

  yield* Effect.log("executed...");
});
```

We now get "Waited 3 seconds":

```
timestamp=2024-07-02T22:14:48.624Z level=INFO fiber=#0 message=executed...
timestamp=2024-07-02T22:14:48.638Z level=INFO fiber=#1 message="Waited 3 seconds"
```

> show JSDocs:
> `forkDaemon` forks the effect into a new fiber attached to the global scope. Because the new fiber is attached to the global scope, when the fiber executing the returned effect terminates, the forked fiber will continue running.

Let's take a look at `fork` and `forkDaemon` signatures:

```ts
export const fork: <A, E, R>(
  self: Effect<A, E, R>
) => Effect<Fiber.RuntimeFiber<A, E>, never, R> = fiberRuntime.fork;

export const forkDaemon: <A, E, R>(
  self: Effect<A, E, R>
) => Effect<Fiber.RuntimeFiber<A, E>, never, R> = fiberRuntime.forkDaemon;
```

As you can see, both must receive an `Effect`, and they both return an `Effect` where the success channel is a `Fiber.RuntimeFiber<A, E>`.

One advantage of receiving the fiber upon creation is the ability to interrupt it later:

```ts
import { Duration, Effect, Fiber, Schedule } from "effect";

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const forkedTask = yield* Effect.log("Called").pipe(
    Effect.repeat({
      schedule: Schedule.spaced(Duration.seconds(0.5)),
      times: 100,
    }),
    Effect.onInterrupt(() => Effect.log("Interrupted fiber")),
    Effect.forkDaemon
  );

  yield* Effect.log("Sleeping...");

  yield* Effect.sleep(Duration.seconds(4)).pipe(
    Effect.andThen(Effect.log("Finished sleeping..."))
  );

  yield* Fiber.interrupt(forkedTask);
});

Effect.runPromise(program);
```

```
timestamp=2024-07-15T12:32:34.537Z level=INFO fiber=#0 message=Sleeping...
timestamp=2024-07-15T12:32:34.541Z level=INFO fiber=#1 message=Called
timestamp=2024-07-15T12:32:35.043Z level=INFO fiber=#1 message=Called
timestamp=2024-07-15T12:32:35.546Z level=INFO fiber=#1 message=Called
timestamp=2024-07-15T12:32:36.049Z level=INFO fiber=#1 message=Called
timestamp=2024-07-15T12:32:36.552Z level=INFO fiber=#1 message=Called
timestamp=2024-07-15T12:32:37.056Z level=INFO fiber=#1 message=Called
timestamp=2024-07-15T12:32:37.562Z level=INFO fiber=#1 message=Called
timestamp=2024-07-15T12:32:38.066Z level=INFO fiber=#1 message=Called
timestamp=2024-07-15T12:32:38.544Z level=INFO fiber=#0 message="Finished sleeping..."
timestamp=2024-07-15T12:32:38.549Z level=INFO fiber=#1 message="Interrupted fiber"
```

As you can see, once it finishes sleeping, it interrupts the fiber, thereby halting its execution.

## But... How can we do a non-blocking .then or .catch?

Remember, what you're forking is an Effect. Which means you can compose an Effect to achieve pretty much the same behavior as a `.then` and `.catch`:

```ts
const fetchTodos = Effect.tryPromise(() => fetch("..."));

Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* fetchTodos.pipe(
    Effect.andThen((response) => ...),
    Effect.catchAll((error) => ...),
    Effect.forkDaemon
  );

  yield* Effect.log("executed!");
})
```
